# TestingFakes
Adding code for tests here to see if I can figure out what is causing my issues with testing.

I am having an issue running code coverage on tests that have fakes in them.  I have created these 
tests to start the process and am adding complexity and comparing them to my failing tests to try 
and get them to fail to help Microsoft fix the issue.  

So far I have found a different issue with Code Coverage, If I have tests in two different libraries 
and I ask for code coverage for both, I only get the information for the last one that runs.
